11.61.0.0/24

---------------
/24 means 24 bits of the 32 bit ip address are already occupied by the network portion
7 subnets required
2^3=8
borrow 3 bits .. 
11.61.0.0/27

hosts per subnet =  2^5 - 2 =30
difference = 256/8 = 32 
Therefore,
11.61.0.0/27
11.61.0.32/27
11.61.0.64/27
11.61.0.96/27
11.61.0.128/27
11.61.0.160/27
