11.61.0.0/16

16 bits -> Network
16 bits -> Hosts
-------------------
9 subnets required
2^4 = 16

4 bits to be taken from host part

11.61.0.0/20

Boston

2000 hosts required
minimum ips 4
hosts per subnet 2^12 - 2 = 4094
required hosts satisfied
difference = 256/16 = 16
we don't want to waste much ips so, taking more bits from host part.. 
11.61.4.0/
128,64,32,16,8,4 = 6 bits to be borrowed

-> 11.61.4.0/22
now check whether the hosts satisfy.
hosts per subnet = 2^10 - 2 =1022 (not satisfying)
return one bit to host part
-> 128,64,32,16,8 = 5 bits to be borrowed
-> 11.61.0.0/21 -- 11.61.7.0/21
-> 11.61.8.0/21 -- 11.61.15.0/21
hosts per subnet = 2^11 - 2 = 2046 hosts (satisfying)
8.8.5.0
255.255.248.0
subnet mask = 255.255.248.0
-------------------------------------
Karachi
11.61.8.0/21
hosts required 600
min ips 4

next network should be starting with -> 11.61.12.0/

128,64,32,16,8,4 = 6 bits to be borrowed
11.61.12.0/22

hosts per subnet = 2^10 -2 = 1022 (satisfying)
Subnet Mask = 255.255.252.0
subnets:
11.61.8.0/22
11.61.12.0/22
----

London

300 hosts required
min ips 4
11.61.12.0/22
next should be starting with 11.61.16.0/
128,64,32,16,8,4 = 6 bits to be borrowed
11.61.12.0/22
11.61.16.0/22
....

Same pattern will be followed for the rest of the subnets
